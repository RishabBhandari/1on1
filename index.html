  <h1>Let's Help Out...</h1>
  <p>
    Weâ€™ve started an initiative to facilitate highly effective mentorship experiences between college students in need of a strategy to navigate this special environment and college-level mentors who have been through it all in areas like Software Engineering, Product, Finance, and Business Strategy/Ops.
</br></br>

    Our model is to organize cohorts of college students interested in a specific professional area and college level mentors in that relevant field.  To ensure high efficacy yet save students time for recruiting, each mentorship experience will be segmented in 3 chats:
</br>
  1) talking about key pain points of recruitment & discuss high level strategies
</br>
  2) understanding the nitty-gritty of recruitment (i.e. getting interviews, presenting yourself in an interview, etc) and
</br>
  3) addressing key interview questions and responses for professional area.
</br></br>

    If you're interested in signing-up as a mentor or mentee, please find the links below.
