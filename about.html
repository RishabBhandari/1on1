    <h1>What's Our Mission? </h1>

    <p> After a long conversation with my friend [George], we wanted to do something to address the increasingly high number of college students who lost their internship or job due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic — we’ve both been through the
      process and understand the frustration of our fellow peers.
      </br></br>
      We recognized that the best professional conversations we’ve received were those that were specific to our context and with people that were highly trained to provide nuanced, highly practical guidance.
      </br></br>

      We realize that it’s tough to learn how to get interviews, how to prep for them, and turn them into offers all in a single 30 minute conversation. So we asked ourselves: how do we replicate the dozens of conversations we’ve had with our
      mentors into a sustainable way to help A LOT of people?
    </p>
    <h1>Who Are We? </h1>
    <p>We're two students driven to give back! Please feel free to email gc489@cornell.edu (George) or rb725@cornell.edu (Rishab) if you have any questions or comments. </p>
    <h1>Who Are Our Mentors? </h1>
    <p> We have mentors from all over the world in almost every industry imaginable from Product Management to Investment Banking to Non-Profits. Some of our mentors are working at companies including Google, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company, and
      more. </p>
